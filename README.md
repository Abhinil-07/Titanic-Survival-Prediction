# Titanic Survival Prediction Model using Naive Bayes Classifier

This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive or not based on a set of features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. The model is built using the Naive Bayes algorithm, which is a probabilistic algorithm commonly used in classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Usage

To use this model, simply clone this repository and run the `Titanic Crash Survival.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains the code for preprocessing the data, training the Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Results

After training and evaluating the model on the Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 78% on the test set.

## Acknowledgements

The project is inspired by the Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition.
